# Steam-Database-Project

This is a project for COMP3005.

It is a database app simulating the steam apis avilable ina  concise manner. I will present informaton about users including they themselves, their gaming habits and achievments and simulated reviews.

Most information will be queried directly from the Steam APIs, however with reviews unavailable on their public APIs they will be AI generated to mimic actual user reviews.
